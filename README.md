# Detecting-Spam-Emails


A deep learning model built with TensorFlow to classify emails as Spam or Ham (Not Spam). This project demonstrates natural language processing techniques and LSTM neural networks for text classification.

 Features
- Text Preprocessing: Stopword removal, punctuation cleaning, and tokenization
- Deep Learning Model: LSTM architecture with embedding layer
- Class Balancing: Handles imbalanced dataset through downsampling
- Visualization: Word clouds and training metrics
- High Accuracy: Achieves 97% test accuracy

 Tech Stack
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- Pandas, NumPy for data processing
- NLTK for text preprocessing
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud for visualization
